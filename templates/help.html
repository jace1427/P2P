            <h3 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h3>
            1. Start the application by running <code>python3 flask_p2p.py</code><br>
            2. In your web browser navigate to <code>127.0.0.1:5000</code><br>
            3. Select &#39;First-time user click here&#39; on the log in page to go to the registration page.<br>
            4. Enter a username and password then select &#39;Resgister&#39;<br>
            5. Upon successful registration you will be taken back to the log in page.<br>
            6. Enter your credentials from step 4 and select &#39;Log in&#39;.<br>
            7. Upon sucessful log in, you will be taken to the main index page.<br>
            <h3 id="adding-contacts-exchanging-keys-and-messaging">Adding Contacts, Exchanging Keys, and Messaging</h3>
            <p>Located on the index page are two main areas, the Message Log and the Contacts section.
            Under the Contacts section you will see your username displayed along with your friendcode.
            This friendcode is all you need to share with someone you want to chat with. It is a special number that contains your ip address, port number, and user ID. You will see two friendcodes displayed. One is generated using your public ipaddress, the other is generated with the localhost address (127.0.0.1). The second friendcode is used for local testing.</p>
            <p>Below your friendcode is where you can enter the name and friendcode of someone you want to add as a contact. Simply enter the information into the designated text boxes and select &#39;Add Contact&#39;.</p>
            <p>Once a contact has been added it is time to exchange keys.</p>
            1. Select the message button next to the contacts name.<br>
            2. Select the initiate key exchange button located below the message log.<br>
            <p>Once keys have been exchanged, messages can be sent. </p>
            1. Select the &#39;Message&#39; button next to the contact you wish to message. Selecting the &#39;Message&#39; button should populate the chat log with any messages stored in the database between you and the selected contact. <br>
            2. Enter your message into the text box underneath the Message Log and select &#39;Send&#39;.<br>
            3. The sent message should be displayed in the message log, along with any previous messages.<br>
            <p>NOTE: successful messaging relies on both parties being online and logged in to the application.</p>
            <h3 id="testing-the-application-locally">Testing the Application Locally</h3>
            <p>In order to test the messaging features of the application on your machine yourself, you will need to make a copy of the application files in another folder on your machine. Edit the copy flask_p2p.py in line [246] to use port 5001 instead of port 5000. Then edit the config.txt to use a different port, say 5555 instead of 5550.</p>
            1. Open one browser window and navigate to 127.0.0.1:5000, and open another window and navigate to 127.0.0.1:5001. <br>
            2. Follow the &quot;Getting Started&quot; steps in each window. <br>
            3. Add each other as contacts using the internal friencode.<br>
            4. In one of the windows, select the Message button next to their contact.<br>
            5. Then select the initiate key exchange button.<br>
            6. Start sending messages back and forth!<br>
            <h4 id="receiving-messages-from-outside-your-lan">Receiving messages from outside your LAN</h4>
            <p>Initially the application is set to listen on the local host address &#39;127.0.01&#39; in the config.txt. This will work fine for receiving messages from different ports on your machine. If you want to try receving messages from outside your local network the server must be set to listen to your machines ipv4 address. This can be found in the network settings (mac) or by running /ipconfig in a cmd prompt for windows.</p>
            <p>In order to receive messages addressed to your public ip address, it might be necessary to forward the required port in your router settings. </p>
